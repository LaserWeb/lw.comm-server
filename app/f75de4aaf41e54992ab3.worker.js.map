If more than one token can match the same string, the last added wins.\n *\n * @memberOf XRegExp\n * @param {RegExp} regex Regex object that matches the new token.\n * @param {Function} handler Function that returns a new pattern string (using native regex syntax)\n *   to replace the matched token within all future XRegExp regexes. Has access to persistent\n *   properties of the regex being built, through `this`. Invoked with three arguments:\n *   - The match array, with named backreference properties.\n *   - The regex scope where the match was found: 'default' or 'class'.\n *   - The flags used by the regex, including any flags in a leading mode modifier.\n *   The handler function becomes part of the XRegExp construction process, so be careful not to\n *   construct XRegExps within the function or you will trigger infinite recursion.\n * @param {Object} [options] Options object with optional properties:\n *   - `scope` {String} Scope where the token applies: 'default', 'class', or 'all'.\n *   - `flag` {String} Single-character flag that triggers the token. This also registers the\n *     flag, which prevents XRegExp from throwing an 'unknown flag' error when the flag is used.\n *   - `optionalFlags` {String} Any custom flags checked for within the token `handler` that are\n *     not required to trigger the token. This registers the flags, to prevent XRegExp from\n *     throwing an 'unknown flag' error when any of the flags are used.\n *   - `reparse` {Boolean} Whether the `handler` function's output should not be treated as\n *     final, and instead be reparseable by other tokens (including the current token).
